# GenderBiasinResumeRanking
A research project conducted under ASDRP.
ABSTRACT:
Hiring software are designed to pick candidates based purely on merit but often reflect biases rooted in society,
such as gender and racial biases. Resume-ranking software, commonly used by recruiters to sift through resumes, select the
top resumes to help employers find the optimal candidate for job recruitment. While analyzing resumes to select the most
qualified candidates, the algorithm might be influenced by traditionally gender-biased words, which could lead to potential
implicit gender bias. In our research, we explore how the ranking of resumes on a popular hiring website, Indeed.com, is
affected by a potential implicit bias using two methods: first analyzing the gender-tone of the most common words in the top
ten and bottom ten resumes, and then examining the relationship between the inferred gender of the resume as determined
by its masculinity percent and the rank of the resume . As hiring based algorithms are becoming increasingly prevalent among
employers, our results provide insightful information about the impartiality of resume-ranking software.
